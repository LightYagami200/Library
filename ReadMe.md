# PopupMaker Code Snippet Library

This repository contains a set of code snippet files found throughout <a href="https://docs.wppopupmaker.com/" target="_blank">the 
online documentation for the Popup Maker plugin</a> to WordPress. These code snippets demonstrate examples of how to extend 
and/or modify the plugin's behavior to achieve a specific endpoint.  The files are organized by the documentation section in 
which they are presented (for example, 'How To', 'Troubleshooting', 'Extensions', etc.).

## Installation 

Users are likely to require only one file at a time, rather than the entire repository to address their particular use case.
In that situation, simply select the file of interest, and then click on the button labeled 'Raw' at the top of the window.
The file contents will open in a new window. Copy the code segment you require and add it to your project. 

The entire code snippet library can be downloaded from the repository landing page. Select the green 
button labeled 'Clone or Download' from the top of the repository directory landing page. If using the GitHub Desktop 
application locally on your computer, select the option 'Open in Desktop'. Else, select the option 'Download ZIP' to 
download the entire archive. Then open the download using an archive utility.  Work with the archive files in your 
integrated development editor (IDE) as you need them.

Refer to the Popup Maker documentation for guidance on where and how to add a specific code snippet into your project.
